                I'm Bram, a 20-year-old with a passion for gaming and a strong 
                desire to become a data analyst. I've always loved playing games
                , and I feel that the skills I've learned from gaming, such as 
                problem-solving and strategic thinking, could be valuable in a 
                career as a data analyst. I'm always looking to improve my skills,
                 and I'm excited to take on new challenges in the virtual world.
